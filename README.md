# betterString
 String constructor wrapper for GameMaker Studio 2.3.2+

Note: Documentation for this is currently unavaible as I'm still working on many of the internal aspects. 
But otherwise, most of it is highly functional. If you've come from GameMaker Kitchen, you may ask me from the server about it.
